# ToDoApp

This is currently at MVP stage.

### The Tech Stack :
- **Front-end** : HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Back-end** : NodeJS
- **Database** : MySQL -> Amazon RDS + Amazon S3

You can simply add tasks that you want to get done. It gets sorted by time of added. To the database and webpages are dynamic and do not require the pages to reload.

Made heavy use of Promises to deal with the async querying of the databases.

Currently working on integrating Amazon S3 so one can add attachments to the lists like files or pictures to help complete the task or as a supporting file. Amazon RDS is already integrated.

I am more into the back-end so the front end is very minimal.

Enjoy!
